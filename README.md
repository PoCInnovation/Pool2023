# 👋 Welcome to PoC Pools 2023!

PoC is a student innovation center.

Every year, we organize innovation weeks in a "pool" format to introduce people to our different fields. We start with the basics and then we go further and further in the concepts we cover. The objective is to give people a very solid technical background, to realize any project.

Here are our fields:
- 🧠 [Artificial Intelligence]()
- 🔑 [Security]()
- 💻 [Software](./Software/)
- 🕸️ [Peer-To-Peer]()
- 👓 [AR-VR](./AR-VR/)

We put all our heart to work, we hope you will enjoy it and that it will be useful to you.
