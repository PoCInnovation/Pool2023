## Introduction üìª

Pshhh ! Pshhh ! (sound of talky walky)

*You pick up the walky talky*

Hello solider ! As I can see, you choose the royal way today. This is great because I need you.

We need to build a new war robot, it's name is "the destroyer 300".

## Step 1 - Hello world üëã

First of all, we need to start the app. 

To do that, you need to create a new **module** app. In the **src/app** folder.

I recommend you to use the **cli** provided with **nest** with the command

```bash
# command for creating a module
npx nest g module app
```

This module serve us to **test** if **the app is running**.

After create a the new module you need to create a new controller in the folder 'src/app/controller/app'.

*It's important to structure your files well in this type of application because there are often many files very quickly and it is important to browse it.*

you can use the command:
```bash
# command for creating a controller
npx nest g controller ./app/controller/app
```

In this controller create one route **GET /app** to display a hello world

you can use the command:
```bash
# command for creating a service
npx nest g service ./app/service/app
```

To display a hello a world, **create** a new **service** in the folder **src/app/service/app** with a method **helloWorld** that return the string **"hello world !"**

Inject this service in your controller and return the result of the method helloWorld.

After that, install the **SwaggerUi package** and create **a tag** for **the controller**.

## Step 2 - Repeat info ü¶ú

Now begin the warm-up ! In this step yo need to learn how to use nestjs and how to get all the informations that you need.


Here are the steps to follow:
- Create a **new module repeat-info**
- Create a **new controller repeat-info**
- Create a **route GET 'repeat-info/repeat-my-query'** that **reapeat query params**
- Create a **route GET 'repeat-info/repeat-my-param/:myParam'** that **repeat param**
- Create a **route POST 'repeat-info/repeat-my-body'** that **reapeat the body**
- Create a route **GET 'repeat-info/repeat-my-header'** that **repeat the headers**


### Important ‚ö†Ô∏è

Because you are in **TypesScript** you need to **type all the informations** that you **receive in your app**. For the body, create a dto/repeat-info folder in your module and create a repeat-info-dto.ts file. In this file create a RepeatMyBodyDto class with a message property in readonly (type string). If you wants more informations about dto, check this article: 


## Step 3 - Soldier ü™ñ

Can't handle no more ? ah ah ah it's just the begining ! 

In this this step we will create a soldier module. Th goal of this module is to allow you te create, update, get and delete a soldier. For security the robot this informations to allow you to using it.

Here are the steps to follow:
-  Create a **new module soldier** 
-  Create a **new service soldier** 
-  Create five method: **create, update, get, getAll, delete.**
-  Use the **prismaService service** to **interact** with **the database**
-  Create routes **to interact** with your **service's methodes**

### Important ‚ö†Ô∏è

You need to **create one type of dto per request that requires a body**. For example if you want to create, and update a weapon in a module you need to create one **CreateWeaponDto** and one **UpdateWeaponDto** (with nullable properties because we not need to update all info all times).

*If you don't know the informations to set in your dto, check the prisma.module file*


## Step 4 - Data validation üëÆ

Nice ! It's works ! However there are things missing. We need to be sure of the information that we receive in our robot.

Here are the steps to follow:
- Setup the **class-validator** library
- Use decorator to check if: **soldierSecret, firstName, lastName** are **strings** and **grade** is a **GradeType enum**. You need to do this for all dto that you need for your body.


## Step 5 - Confidential information üîí

Great ! Now we can intercat with a soldier model but we need to **be sure** of **the informations** provided when **we interact** with **it**. 

We have one **last thing** to do for **this part** of the **robot**. **Keep sensitive information secret.**

Indeed, **the soldierSecret informations must not leave the application**.
The **enemy should not be able** to **take control** of our **robot**. To do that we will use **serialization**.


Here are the steps to follow:
- Create a **SoldierCreatedDto** class
- Create a **SoldierUpdatedDto** class
- Create a **SoldierFoundDto** class
- Create a **SoldierDeletedDto** class
- Exclude the property **soldierSecret**
- Declare a **partial contructor** on each class
- **Return the good dto** in **each service's method** and **each controller's method**
- Use the **ClassSerializerInterceptor** in the **main**


### Important ‚ö†Ô∏è

If you wants to **exclude a variable** in a **dto** you need to **construct your object** with the keyword **new** and **to use the constructor**.  

## Step 6 - Identity check üõÇ

Before create the robot module, we need to construct an auth system. To do this, we need use the **jwt passport module**. 

First of all I reccomand you to **read the documentation** about it in the **nestjs documentation**

Here are the steps to follow:
- Create a **new auth module**
- Create a **new auth controller** with a route **POST '/auth/login' route**
- Create **a new jwtAuthService** with **two methods** one for **valitateSolider** with his **id** and one for **login the user with is id and soldierSecret**
- Create a **jwtStrategy** in a **folder /strategy/jwt** in the **auth module**. in its constructor **extract the token from bearer** and create a method that **validate a soldier** with a **jwt payload**. This method must call the **jwtAuthService validate method to validate the user**.


## Important ‚ö†Ô∏è

You need to use the **bcrypt library** to hash the passport. This data is very sensitive it's therefore necessary to the **cipher** to avoid that the enemy can obtain it even if the database leak.

## Step 7 - The destroyer 300 ü§ñ

Youhou ! it‚Äôs time to show who is the boss ! Let's create the robot and its weapon.

Here are the steps to follow:
- Create a **new robot module**
- Create a **new robot controller** with a **GET '/robot/fire' route**
- Create a **new robot service** with a **fire method** that **returns one of these strings randomly** (you can add your own if you wants): 'piou piou', 'tou tou tou', 'ratatatata', 'bang', 'pow'
- Create a **JwtAuthGuard** in the **auth module** in a **folder guard/jwt**
- **call the fire method** in the **robot controller** and **protect this route with the guard**


Tada !! We can make a nice fireworks !

## Bonus - Unitary tests ‚úÖ

Now that the robot is working it's important to make sure that it will continue to work. A real soldier has to do clean work! Good thing the unit tests are here !

In this step you need to **unitary test all your app**.
